## What is this?
I don't know how you find it. It's my backup for my studying in [leetcode](https://leetcode-cn.com). Each problem a file and named in Chinese. I think it's nearly useless for you.

## How to use it
1. Install VSCode plugin. You should install the LeetCode plugin.
2. Create a input file and change the content depends on the question you need to solve.
```shell
$ echo 'TestCase' > input
```
